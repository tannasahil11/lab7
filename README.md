## Setup 
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


## Testing and Error Handling

- Performed Manual Testing of all the routes and serving of 404 page for any undefined route. (App contains 4 routes /, /home, /about, /projects)
- Error handling implemented by capturing all the undefined routes to serve 404 page with option to go back, site validated by W3C checker.
- Multiple browsers such as mozilla, chrome, opera, edge were used to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
